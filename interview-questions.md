# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: 
    JSX: Is part of the React User Interface web application, and was created by FaceBook. With JSX developers can create dynamic UI web applications. JSX is a hybrid syntax that merges HTML and JavaScript. For instance, unlike HTML in JSX a developer can invoke a JS function in what would be the "body" in HTML. 

Researched answer:
    JavaScript XML, commonly known as JSX, is a JavaScript library that is used by developers to create code the resembles HTML. Developers use JSX using React to create complex UI web applications. Although, it may look like a developer is running HTML code inside JavaScript, the compilation of code inbeded insided of the React framework its actually JavaScript code.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: It stands for 'yet another resorce negotiator'. 

Researched answer:

Yarn is an open source project manager that was introduce by Facebook with the collaboration of Google, Exponent, and Tilde. Yarn allows the sharing of data between developers to occur much faster, more secure, and reliable. 

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A React component is a stand alone function that a developer can use to store behavioral code for specific instances. The use of components compartmentalizes the code inside of a web application. This allows the rendering process to render specific features/items, and will render other components when a specific user interactions instances occur. If I wanted to create a UI web application used a chat box or a like button features. I could create a specific component for each of the features.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: 
A react state is special variable that allows a component to perform or behave by storing data. While a react prop is a read-only properties that allow a parent component to communicate with its child component. 

Researched answer:
    React Props: allows communication to flow from parent componets to child components. 
    React States: allows the management of data only within a component

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: Document Object Model and is used to track the interaction of a user such as key strikes, cursor movement, or eye movements.

Researched answer:

DOM is like a map that allows the computer to know where each of the elements of a web page are located. Developers can make changes to different parts of web page and create more dynamic and interactive web pages.  

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: I am not sure what a span tag is, but if I was to take a wild guess. A span tag <></> is used to encase different types of tags that are used along side each other within a 'return'. While <div> tags render a break(space) on a web page. For instance if I have two paragraph encased in <p> tags, inserting <div> in between both paragraphs produces a seperation between the two paragraphs once it is rendered on a browser. 

Researched answer: I was wrong about <span> tags and <div> tags. While both <span> and <div> tags create a container, the <div> can create a container around multiple elements, the <span> can create a container within each element.
