# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: 
    JSX: This is part of the React User Interface web application created by FaceBook. With JSX, developers can create dynamic UI web applications. JSX is a hybrid syntax that merges HTML and JavaScript. For instance, unlike HTML in JSX, a developer can invoke a JS function in the "body" in HTML. 

Researched answer:
    JavaScript XML, commonly known as JSX, is a JavaScript library that developers use to create code that resembles HTML. Developers use JSX using React to develop complex UI web applications. Although it may look like a developer is running HTML code inside JavaScript, the compilation of code embedded inside the React framework is JavaScript code.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: It stands for 'yet another resource negotiator'. 

Researched answer:

Yarn is an open-source project manager that Facebook introduced with the collaboration of Google, Exponent, and Tilde. Yarn allows data sharing between developers to occur faster, more securely, and more reliably. 

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A React component is a stand-alone function that developers can use to store behavioral code for specific instances. The use of components compartmentalizes the code inside of a web application. This allows the rendering process to render specific features/items and render other components when specific user interactions occur. If I wanted to create a UI web application use a chat box or a like button feature. I could create a specific component for each of the features.

Researched answer:

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: 
A react state is a special variable that allows a component to perform or behave by storing data. While a react prop is a read-only property that allows a parent component to communicate with its child component. 

Researched answer:
    React Props: allows communication to flow from parent components to child components. 
    React States: allows the management of data only within a component.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: Document Object Model is used to track a user's interaction, such as key strikes, cursor movement, or eye movements.

Researched answer:

DOM is like a map that allows the computer to know where each of the elements of a web page are located. Developers can change different parts of the web page and create more dynamic and interactive web pages.  


6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: I don't know what a span tag is, but if I were to take a wild guess. A span tag <></> is used to encase different types of tags that are used alongside each other within a 'return.' In contrast, <div> tags render a break(space) on a web page. For instance, if I have two paragraphs encased in <p> tags, inserting <div> between both paragraphs produces a separation between the two sections once rendered on a browser. 

Researched answer: I needed to be corrected about <span> tags and <div> tags. While both <span> and <div> tags create a container, the <div> can create a container around multiple elements, and the <span> can create a container within each element. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: a programming model that organizes software design based on objects or data rather than functions and logic. The structure of object-oriented programming includes: classes, objects, methods, and attributes. An exmple, a person can be classified as an object beloning to a class, with his/her name being the object, thier home address being their property, and singing being a method. 

2. Ruby: Ruby is an object-oriented programming language created by Yukushiro "Matz" Matsumoto and publically released in 1995. Because Ruby is object-oriented, everything in Ruby is an object, meaning that data can have its own actions and properties. 

3. Implicit return: This means that there is no requirement to type "return" in the last line of the code within a method 

4. Ruby blocks: Blocks are small anonymous functions that can be plassed inside of a function. {blocks} or do block end.

5. Ruby hashes: Hashes are key-value pair structures of data that are used to store data.
